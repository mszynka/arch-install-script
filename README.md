## Arch Linux install script
Forked from teateawhy and guys from bbs.archlinux.org forum

### Usage
After download via `git` or `wget` change `chmod` to executable.
Before executing
```
sh arch-install.sh {hostname}
``` you should edit some of the basic stuff like `locale`, `dest_disk`, `keymap` or `timezone` as well as `swap_size` and `root_size`. After that it's just a matter of running the script and answering the questions.
